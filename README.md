# minion-css-illustration

### info
This is a css project I started to test my CSS skills. It is an illustration of a minion(the liitle yellow animation guys).

### note
 - This illustration is not responsive.
 - It was written on a 15.6" laptop, and is in the right dimensions when screen is split vertically.
 
## technologies
 - HTML
 - CSS
 - SASS

## setup
 - To see the illustration, download the project and run the index.html file with your browser.
 - The only time you would need a SASS compiler is if you feel the need to alter the code.
